# Main Concepts

We use an abstraction called "Deal" to pass information between parties. For any given business scenario you set Deal participants, roles, scenario steps and step-by-step transition map. We then apply universal rules to translate Deal into DLT operations, pass it to the recipient and represent back in a structured Deal logic on a recipientâ€™s side.

Deal is simple but smart. It can cover a wide range of scenarios from pure document exchange between companies to multistage contract execution. In some cases you may want to use a combination of Deals for your process, e.g. if a scenario is complex and multilayered or contains stages with markedly different sets of parties involved.
