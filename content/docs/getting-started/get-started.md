# Get started

We have prepared some use cases for you to try out the Kekker Platform.

Each case contains a business description and a script consisting of a sequence API calls
You can execute scripts in the command line or terminal. 

Cases are presented in order of increasing complexity and each subsequent case demonstrates platform's new features
You are free to use scripts as is or make changes to them based on your requirements. In addition, you can create your own transition maps as per your business processes.
